Client Service Management System

This project is a Client Service Management System written in C++ that allows you to manage client details, including their ID, Name, Service, and Budget. This system provides a menu-driven approach to add, update, delete, and view client records, making it useful for small businesses, service-based companies, or anyone who needs to maintain client information.

Features:

Add Clients: Allows users to add one or more client records to the system by entering their details such as ID, name, service, and budget.
Update Clients: Users can update a client's service or budget information by specifying the client ID and the field they want to update.
Delete Clients: Allows users to delete a client's information based on the client ID.
Show Clients: Displays all the stored client details, making it easy to review and manage the client records.
Menu-based Navigation: The system is interactive with a clear menu for the user to choose different actions.
Dynamic Record Management: The program dynamically handles multiple client records, adjusting the list size based on operations performed (like adding or deleting).

Files in the Project:

client.cpp: This is the main file where all client operations are performed. It defines a client class that includes methods for setting and getting client information. The system interacts with users through a command-line interface (CLI), prompting them for input based on various operations (Add, Update, Delete, Show).
